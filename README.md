This is my July One Game A Month entry. Its a japanese number puzzle game known originally has Nonograms. It goes by many other names like Picross, Paint-By-Numbers or Griddlers. Those are just some of the name there are many more. If your really interested in reading about it here is the link to the Wikipedia Article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

There are only 10 10x10 puzzles in the game and when you finish the last one it starts all over again with the first one. I had a real interesting time coding this as AS3 does not have built in 2D arrays. Basically you need to use an Array of Arrays. Once I started thinking like that all the problems I had were quickly fixed.
